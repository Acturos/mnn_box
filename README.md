# mnn_box
A python package used for reproducing the moment mapping neural network on cpus using `numpy` functionality.

Moment mapping nn is a spiking neural nn which can implement feedforward process based  concentrating on 
some statistics of spike pattern. Inspired from deep learning, we aim to construct a complete mnn framework and 
compare the effects with mlp based on `pytorch`.
